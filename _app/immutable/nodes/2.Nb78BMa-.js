I've spent years solving problems, building tools, and tinkering with everything from embedded devices to open-source projects. I thrive on challenges, constantly learning new things and pushing the limits of what’s possible. To me, it’s not just about the tech—it’s about creating something that makes life easier, more fun, and connects people. If you like the tools I create, you’ll find that the community around them is just as passionate and welcoming. I’m always on the lookout for the next puzzle to solve, and if it catches my eye, you can bet I’ll tackle it with everything I’ve got.</p></div></section> <section class="projects svelte-7scm92"><h2 class="svelte-7scm92">My Projects</h2> <div class="project svelte-7scm92"><a class="project-link svelte-7scm92"><img alt="Nerd HUD Next Logo" class="project-logo svelte-7scm92"> <span class="project-name svelte-7scm92">NerdHUD Next</span></a></div></section>`,1);function x(p){var c=b(),t=a(d(c),2),h=e(t);n(h,"src",`${i??""}/mnemonicpunk.png`),m(2),s(t);var l=a(t,2),r=a(e(l),2),o=e(r);n(o,"href",`${i??""}/nerdhud/`);var v=e(o);n(v,"src",`${i??""}/nerdhudnext_logo.png`),m(2),s(o),s(r),s(l),u(p,c)}export{x as component,w as universal};
